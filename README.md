# 04-Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Project Description

This week's assignment required me to build a timed quiz application from scratch. The assignment required that I build a start page from which you can read a brief description of the quiz click the "start" button to begin taking it. Once the start button is clicked there must be 5 quiz questions that appear one at a time and clicking the desired answer on the currently loaded question will cause that question to disappear and the next to be brought into view. Once the user has selected their answer for the last question the timer is to stop and a score page where they can see their score, input their name and save both the score/name to local storage should load. Though not included in the acceptance criteria I included a high scores page as the true purpose behind requesting the app seemed to be that the user wanted to compare their knowledge with that of their peers and a high score page would be a fun way to do exactly that.
